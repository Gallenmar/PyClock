This program is a Python program that uses the Pygame library to draw a clock on the screen. The clock consists of a circle with tick marks around the circumference, a minute hand, an hour hand, and a second hand. The program uses a **2D transformation algorithm** to continuously update the position of the clock hands as they rotate around the center of the clock. 

One can adjust the speed of the clock by using arrow keys or the number row. Additionaly this program can change color themes.
